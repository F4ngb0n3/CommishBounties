# Commish Bounties

*Minecraft Bounty Plugin*

Ready to start tagging people with offenses? Players getting a little too comfortable getting away with griefing/trolling? Want to just bring some extra fun and competition to your server?

**Commish Bounties** brings a simple but effective bounty system to your server! Create bounties, reduce amounts, alert all active players... just about everything you would need to manage bounties!

Just another note... be sure to get your **Bounty Hunter License** from a **Bondsman** (*Someone who has the bondsman permissions*) before you go around, raising hell! Collecting a bounty, (killing a player with a bounty) and NOT having a license will result in some ***PRETTY negative*** outcomes...
