# Interactive Features:

**Commish** now has an interactive `Arrest / Cuff` function that allows you to capture your bounties alive and turn them in for a possibly bigger profit! You **MUST** be a **Bounty Hunter** to use this function, _**AND**_ have a pair of **Zip Cuffs** in your hand!

> NOTE:  
> _Zip Cuffs are now default given to every player that is issued a **NEW** Bounty Hunter License from a Bondsman_

**How To Cuff:**
1. Walk up to the Criminal
2. With the **Zip Cuffs** in hand, right-click the Criminal
3. Their status will change to cuffed and their interaction will be disabled
####  

**How to Un-Cuff:**
1. Walk up to Player
2. With the **Zip Cuffs** in hand, right-click the Player
3. Their status will change to un-cuffed and interaction will be enabled (**THIS DOES NOT REMOVE THE BOUNTY**)

####  

Cuffing a Criminal gives the plugin a more realistic feel, and when the Criminal is brought to the Bondsman, the Bounty can be removed and the payout can be given to the Player via whatever Economy plugin you have hooked. Bount Hunters can STILL kill their Bounty Targets! This is just an added feature to give a more abundance on immersion and options.
